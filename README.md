# Apriori Algorithm
The dataset used for this project will be loaded and saved to a data frame automatically. By running the project, you'll be able to see different frequent itemsets.
For generating rules I used one of the association rule mining algorithms called <b>apriori</b> algorithm.

Also check [apyori documentation](https://pypi.org/project/apyori/) for more information.

# Components
Due to resources limitation, I had to limit some components of this algorithm. Feel free to change them for more convenient results.

# Output
After rules being generated and finding different frequent itemsets, you'll see graph objects for the first five itemsets.
